- PowerShell execution policy set to allow script execution. See [Setting Execution Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy) for more details.
- All CSV files that need to be combined should be in the same folder, and this folder should not contain any other files that you do not want to combine.

## Usage

1. Place all your CSV files in one folder along with the PowerShell Script.
